# What is Python - 
# 	High level, interpreted programming language
# * Web Development (e.g django, Flask)
# * Data Science and Machine Learning (e.g pandas, TensorFlow)
# * Automation (e.g scripting tasks)
# * Software development and many more

# Why is it so popular -
# 	* Easy to learn
# 	* community support
# 	* Cross-platform 
# 	* Versatile 

# Python - SetUp 
# 	https://www.python.org/
# 	go to download and download latest version
# 	select add to path and install now

# Python - IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
# 	* PyCharm (community edition - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/editions/)
# 	* VS Code
# 	* jupyter Notebook

# verify the installation
# 	"python --version" in cmd

# Key Features of Python
# 	* Simple syntax 
# 	* Interpreted - executed line by line
# 	* Dynamically Typed - No Need to declare the variable types explicitly
# 	* Object-Oriented - Supports OOP (Object oriented programming) like classes and objects
# 	* Rich Standard Library - it has built in modules
# 1st code
# open IDE -> Create a python file 1.py -> print("Hello") -->in terminal run "python 1.py"

print("Hello, world!!")

# variables & Data types in python
x = 5
# print(type(x))
X = 6
y = "Hello"
is_true = True
#print(type(y))

# type conversion
x = "10"
print(x)
print(type(x))
a = float(x)
print(a)
print(type(a))
b = int(a)
print(b)
print(type(b))

# Airthmetic Operation
# + addition
# - sub
# * mul
# / div
# // floor div
# % modulus
# ** Exponentiation

a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a // b)
print(a % b)
print(a ** b)

# assigning values to multiple variables
x,y,z = 11,12,13
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# variable reassigment
g = 5
print(g)
g = 10
print(g)
